BATL
====

BATL(basic algorithm template library) is a c++ template library for basic and simple algorithm. such as `search`, `sort`, `tree`, `graph` and so on.

I do it for learn c++ STL and simple algorithm.

In the furture, you can also add advanced data structures and algorithms in this library.

DIR TREE
--------

    namespace al 
    include/ *.hpp
    src/ *.cpp

DONE

    -Binary Search
    -Hash Search
    -Bubble Sort
    -Insert Sort
    -Quick Sort
    -Radix Sort
    -Shell Sort
    -Select Sort
    -Heap Sort
    -Prim's minimum spanning tree
    -Depth First Search

TODO List
